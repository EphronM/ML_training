# Day 1 of ML Training

Basic fundamentals of Machine Learning concepts


## Things to know before deep dive
    1. What is the definition of a "Model"?
    2. How should one understand the notion of "Modeling" in the context of Visual models,
       Data models, Mathematical models, Programming models, Process models, and the like.
    3. What are some examples of Visualization models?
    4. When and how to choose a visual model for a given use case?
    5. What is the primary purpose of a Scatter plot concerning the 
       characteristics of a given data set?
    6. What is a "Distribution"?
    7. How do we identify Discrete distribution from Continuous?
    8. How does a histogram help us understand univariate distributions?
    9. How should a scatter plot be converted into a data distribution?
    10. What is a "Data Model"?




## Assignment

- Estimate the distribution of vowels, stopwords, and punctuations
  from a given corpus of text files.
- Generate random numbers between [1-100] for {1k,10k, 100k, 1m, 10m} times and verify if the distribution is uniform. 
  Also, measure and plot the MAE to check if the error decreases with increased sample size.


  Happy Coding!
